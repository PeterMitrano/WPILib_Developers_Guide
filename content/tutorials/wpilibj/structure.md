# Structure of WPILibJ

WPILibJ is the java WPI Library for FRC. It is located within the allwpilib project at `allwpilib\wpilibj`. Like most other things in allwpilib, it is built using gradle. In this case, the result of this is a JAR file, called `wpilibj.jar`. There is also a Simulation version of wpilibj, which creates `wpilibjSimulation.jar`. Within the wpilibj folder, you'll find (amoung other things) the following:

    wpilibJava
    wpilibJavaDevices
    wpilibJavaSim
    wpilibJavaFinal
    wpilibJavaJNI
    wpilibJavaIntegrationTests
