## Structure

This website uses nanoc, a ruby static webpage generator, to turn markdown into webpages. If you're not familiar with nanoc or ruby, that's ok. I wasn't either when I started. The main stuff you'll want to edit is in the content directory, and adding a new page is as simple as adding a new .md file. They're all automagically turned into webpages when you run `nanoc`.
