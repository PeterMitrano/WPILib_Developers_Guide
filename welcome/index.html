      #Welcome!

### Being a WPILib developer is awesome, and its people like you who make WPILib and even FIRST possible!

##Background
My name is Peter (robotwizard@wpi.edu) and I will serve as your guide through these tutorials. Totally email me if you run into any problems! I did FRC for two years using WPILib, and I have been working on it ever since B-Term of my freshman year. In otherwords, I know what is going on by now. However, I did not when I started. Even after almost a year of development I still was not familiar with a lot of the project. That is why I am starting this tutorial--To save you the pain I went through when I started.

##Ready
These tutorial are fairly simply structured, and I intened to keep working on them as I do WPILib. So if you see this and think I need to add something, email me and complain about it. Go through them in any order you like, because it's all topic based and I sure as heck didn't write them in any logical order.

##Set
I thought it would be really neat if I included a "read-set-go" motif to this, but I ran out of information to fill this with. All the real info is in the other tutorials.

##GO!!!
Go forth, young grashopper! Read the other tutorials! Hang out in Brad's office (there are never enough chairs)! And most of all have fun. This is an awesome way to learn about robots and software.
